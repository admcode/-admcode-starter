- The following extensions enabled in php.ini:

### Configure your environment file

Run the `create-app-env.sh` script and follow the instructions to create a `.env` file to your project.

## Usage

### Important

Your project must be served from the public folder in the server root.

```
// These will work
www.fakedomain.com/public/
localhost/public/

// These won't
www.fakedomain.com/admcode-starter/public/
localhost/admcode-starter/public/
```

### Change your project encryption key

To change your project encryption key, run the `create-app-key.sh` and replace your previous project encryption key in the `.env` file with the key generated.
